This is a GATE plugin for hungarian text processing

To build the plugin you can use Gradle:
gradle build

If you run gradle build without any arguments it will build everything in one pass.
The following files and directories will be created in the build/install dir which is a standard structure of GATE plugins:

magyarlanc-gate-plugin/
  |
  +-- src/
  |     all Java sources.
  +-- doc/
  |     documentation files
  |    +-- javadoc/
  |          standard apidocs generated by javadoc
  +-- lib/
  |     third party libraries used by the plugin.
  +-- resources/
  |     external files used by this plugin (e.g. configuration files, JAPE grammars, gazetteer lists, etc.)
  +-- creole.xml
  |     plugin configuration file for GATE
  +-- magyarlanc-gate-plugin-{version}.jar

Any file placed in src/dist directory will be copied to plugin root in a templatable way (http://mrhaki.blogspot.hu/2010/10/gradle-goodness-parse-files-with.html)
